## 📌 Results & Insights

* 📉 **Gender Inequality Index (GII) & Growth**: Strong negative correlation — higher inequality is linked with lower Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.
* 🏥 **Maternal Mortality**: Inversely related to growth. Countries with high maternal mortality tend to have lower GNI and HDI. Reducing maternal mortality improves development.
* 👶 **Adolescent Birth Rate**: Higher rates impose an economic burden by disrupting female education and labor force participation.
* 🎓 **Female Education**: Strong positive correlation with GNI and HDI. Investing in education enhances labor force participation and drives economic growth.
* 👩‍💼 **Female Labor Force Participation**: Higher participation is consistently associated with stronger economic performance. Policies promoting workforce equality boost productivity.

## 🔮 Future Work

* **Policy Impact Analysis**:

  * Case studies of countries with successful gender equality initiatives.
  * Policy simulations to measure economic impact of reforms.

* **Technological Integration**:

  * Real-time data collection via mobile/IoT for up-to-date monitoring of gender inequality indicators.

## ✅ Conclusion

Gender equality is not just a social issue but an **economic imperative**.
Reducing inequality, improving female education, increasing female labor participation, and addressing maternal mortality and adolescent birth rates can substantially enhance **national income and human development**.
